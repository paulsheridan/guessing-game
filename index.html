    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
      The JavaScript on this page starts by prompting the user for their name
      and saving their input as a variable.  It then creates an alert with the user
      input concatenated into a greeting string. The user is then prompted with 3 questions.
      A correct answer returns a positive alert and adds one to the "points" variable.  An incorrect
      answer doesn't add any points to the "points" variable and returns a negative alert.
      After 3 prompts, the "points" variable is referenced in an "if" statement and one of three final
      alerts is displayed depending on score.

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Paul. I'm a martial artist with a worthless
      Political Science degree. I like beer, Cold War spy novels, Christopher Hitchens
      and the occasional video game!
    </p>
      <h2>Let's play a guessing game!</h2>
    <p>
      You'll be prompted with 3 questions about me. Good luck!
    </p>
